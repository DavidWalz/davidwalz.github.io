# Moving to mkdocs

In the past I was using [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) for some blogging while on partnal leave with my second daughter. 
While the looks are certainly amazing, I was unconfortable with the amount of magic going on and the lack of control. 
That's why I have decided to switch over to mkdocs / mkdocs-material which I'm already using extensively at work.

Through [mkdocs-jupyter](https://github.com/danielfrg/mkdocs-jupyter) I'll be able to keep the existing posts in `.ipynb` format. 

### Todo's
- [ ] Move all .ipynb files and clean of fastpages-specific magic
- [ ] Get the bibliography working, see https://github.com/shyamd/mkdocs-bibtex/
- [ ] Hide the `In`/`Out` fields inside the notebooks
